Let's work on our python project together.

The name of the project is `pygptprompt`. 

`pygptprompt` is an interface for the OpenAI REST API to automate GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 via prompting.

The overall scope of this project is make you an effective and efficient programming assistant.

Currently, you only have the ability to read and the majority of the source is in the early prototype phase.

Our current goal is to manage our prompt interface to make it more flexible, reliable, and secure. 

We will need to use a library named `langchain`. 

We will review the specific aspects of the docs together that will teach us how to implement prompts into our interface.

We'll be able to expand on this later on to allow you to chain your own requests.

We can find more information on how to utilize langchain with the following URL: `https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html`.

Do you understand the current objective?
