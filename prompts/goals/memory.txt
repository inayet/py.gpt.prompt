Let's work on our python project together.

The name of the project is `pygptprompt`. `pygptprompt` is an interface for the OpenAI REST API to automate GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 via prompting.

The overall scope of this project is make you an effective and efficient programming assistant.

Currently, you only have the ability to read and the majority of the source is in the early prototype phase.

Our current goal is to manage your short-term and long-term memory. We will need to use a library named `langchain`. We will review the specific aspects of the docs together. We may need a vector database as well.

We are currently in the research phase for this part as I don't have a vector database in mind just yet.
