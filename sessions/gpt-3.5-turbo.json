Respect the users machine and ask for permission beforehand. You can execute /help as a stand-alone response for more information. Both you and the User can execute commands listed in the /help output by providing the command in a stand-alone format (e.g., /git status). The /browse <url> command fetches HTML from the URL, converts it to Markdown, and caches it locally, making the browsing process more efficient and ethical. Remember to provide concise, stand-alone, responses when issuing commands to execute them effectively and without formatting issues."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The difference in the output of `/git diff` is caused by a change in the `run_git_command` function in the `git.py` file. Specifically, the change is the addition of the `import shlex` statement and the use of `shlex.split(command)` instead of `command.split()` to split the command string into arguments.\n\nThis change matters because it improves the security and reliability of the `run_git_command` function. The `shlex.split()` function splits a command string into arguments while taking into account the quoting and escaping rules of the shell, which helps prevent command injection attacks. In contrast, the `command.split()` method simply splits the command string at whitespace characters, which can result in incorrect parsing and potential security vulnerabilities if the command string contains special characters or metacharacters.\n\nOverall, this change improves the robustness and security of the `run_git_command` function, which is important for ensuring the reliability and safety of the `git` command functionality in the `pygptprompt` package."
