#
# NOTE: SciPy Vulnerability
# There is a known security vulnerability in SciPy.
# We can't specify it here because it breaks the
# dependency chain in Poetry.
# It's noted here because it's open to a Supply
# Chain Attack vector. If possible, this needs to be 
# handled before PyGPTPrompt enters Alpha state.
#
# NOTE: Missing Shared Objects with PyTorch
# Use `pip install torch` to resolve platform specific issues.
# The missing shared objects will be installed as a result.
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59158044/poetry-and-pytorch
# https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2247
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# A workaround for CPU is to use:
# pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# A workaround for ROCm is to use:
# pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
# Nvidia users can proceed as normal. CUDA wheel is default:
# pip3 install torch
