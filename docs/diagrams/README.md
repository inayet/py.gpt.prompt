# Diagrams

**Note**: The diagrams provided here are intended for AI model understanding and
reference, not for human consumption. They may occasionally be inconsistent or
out of sync with the actual codebase. For precise details and code
documentation, always refer directly to the source code, which contains
docstrings and implementation specifics.

## Directory Structure

The `docs/diagrams` directory contains Plant UML and Mermaid diagrams that
provide visual representations of various aspects of the AI models and systems.
These diagrams are useful for sharing with AI models when specific information
is required without the need to analyze extensive source code.

### Plant UML Diagrams

Plant UML is used to create UML diagrams that help illustrate the structure and
relationships with AI models. Below are the Plant UML diagrams available:

- `chat_model_factory.puml`: Diagram representing the Chat Model Factory.
- `ChatModel.puml`: Diagram illustrating the Chat Model.
- `chat_session_init.puml`: Diagram showcasing the Chat Session Initialization.
- `ChatSession.puml`: Diagram depicting the Chat Session.
- `ConfigurationManager.puml`: Diagram explaining the ConfigurationManager.
- `JSONTemplate.puml`: Diagram representing the JSON Template.
- `SequenceManager.puml`: Diagram illustrating the Sequence Manager.
- `session_manager.puml`: Diagram depicting the Session Manager.
- `session_queue.puml`: Diagram showcasing the Session Queue.
- `vector_store_manager.puml`: Diagram explaining the Vector Store Manager.

### Mermaid Diagrams

Mermaid is used to create flowcharts and sequence diagrams for visualizing
processes and interactions. Below are the Mermaid diagrams available:

- `chat_sequence.mmd`: Sequence diagram illustrating chat-related interactions.
- `chat_session.mmd`: Flowchart representing a chat session.
- `llama.cpp.gpu.mmd`: Diagram related to Llama.cpp and GPU operations.
- `overview.mmd`: Overview diagram of the system or process.
- `settings.mmd`: Diagram related to system settings.

## Usage

These diagrams serve as visual aids for AI models to facilitate understanding
and reference specific aspects of the AI models and system components. When you
need assistance with a particular aspect, such as the JSONTemplate, referencing
the relevant diagram can provide a concise overview without the need to analyze
extensive source code.

**Important**: For detailed information about the codebase, always refer to the
source code, which includes docstrings and specific implementation details.

For any questions or clarifications regarding the diagrams, please feel free to
