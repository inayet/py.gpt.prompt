# The Genesis Model: Exploring Market Analysis with Generative AI

## Abstract

Our journey began with an open-minded exploration, driven by curiosity rather
than a predefined goal. We sought to uncover connections between seemingly
unrelated domains, with the Law of Large Numbers guiding our initial steps.
Little did we anticipate that an accidental discovery would unveil an unexpected
bridge between financial concepts and machine learning principles.

During a playful exercise involving graphing the Principal Amount, a chance
observation struck us—what initially appeared as a financial trajectory bore an
uncanny resemblance to a loss function. This serendipitous moment led us to
realize the striking parallels between a growth model in finance and the
mechanics of machine learning training.

The accidental discovery became a catalyst for our investigation. We set out to
map these parallels and explore how concepts from the realm of compound interest
might offer insights into loss reduction and training dynamics in machine
learning. While our analogy isn't a direct translation of established
methodologies, it serves as an engaging thought experiment that bridges
mathematical frameworks across domains.

## Introduction

In the vast landscape of mathematical modeling, two seemingly disparate fields
often operate in isolation: finance and machine learning. At a glance, these
disciplines may appear to have little in common. Finance typically deals with
the management of money, investments, and risk, while machine learning explores
algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks without
explicit programming. However, a closer examination reveals intriguing parallels
that beckon further exploration.

This document embarks on an interdisciplinary journey to uncover the underlying
connections between financial models and machine learning algorithms. A
particular point of intrigue lies in the relationship between Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM), a principle fundamental to machine learning, and the Value
Averaging strategy commonly employed in finance.

ERM, an NP-hard problem, involves the search for a model that minimizes the
average loss on a given dataset. In contrast, the Value Averaging strategy
introduces a form of linearity within financial planning, a characteristic that
may at first seem unrelated to ERM. However, the correlation between these
concepts forms a bridge that connects the complexities of machine learning with
the principles of financial management.

The analogy, while compelling on a conceptual level, is admittedly rough and
sparse in its current form. The correlation is primarily based on scalar values,
and it's in the early stages of development, meaning nothing concrete is
directly applicable at this moment.

The inspiration for this exploration was sparked by the visual representation of
the Principal Amount over time, resembling a loss (or risk) function commonly
encountered in machine learning. Though the analogy may have limitations – for
instance, machine learning models often work with matrices, contrasting the
scalar approach in finance – the potential insights derived from bridging these
domains warrant a detailed investigation.

This document aims to:

- Elucidate the conceptual connections between finance and machine learning.
- Recognize the constraints and limitations that might hinder direct
  applicability.
- Lay the groundwork for potential innovations, with the understanding that the
  work is exploratory in nature and may lead to novel intersections between
  these fields.

While the connections might not yet be fully realized, this exploration marks
the beginning of a promising pathway, one that could yield profound insights
into both fields and create opportunities for unprecedented collaboration.

## Exploring Conceptualizations and Terminologies

Initially, we employed the concept of compound interest from the realm of
finance, defined as follows:

```
periodic_interest_rate = interest_rate / frequency
growth_rate = pow(periodic_interest_rate, interval)
target_amount = principal_amount * interval * growth_rate
```

- The `principal_amount` remains constant.
- The `growth_rate` is also consistent, as the periodic interest rate is fixed
  and the interval is 1 for daily compounding.
- The `interval` is the variable, representing the number of days.

Given the constancy of the principal amount and growth rate, the relationship
between the interval and target amount is linear. Clarifications aside, we can
now proceed with a proper review of our work, considering the accurate
interpretation of the frequency parameter.

**Terminology Conversion: Aligning Financial Model with Machine Learning**

1. **Periodic Rate (Financial) → Step Size (Machine Learning):**

   - Represents incremental change at each interval or step in the sequence.
     Reflects the magnitude of change during each update.

2. **Growth Rate (Financial) → Improvement Rate (Training) / Decay (Loss
   Function) (Machine Learning):**

   - Represents the rate of growth or decay over time. In training, it mirrors
     the model's learning rate. In a loss function, it signifies the reduction
     in loss over time.

3. **Target Amount (Financial) → Label/Desired Outcome (Machine Learning):**

   - Denotes the goal or desired result. In finance, it's the target financial
     amount. In machine learning, it's the correct label or outcome for a given
     input.

4. **Principal Amount (Financial) → Loss (Machine Learning):**

   - Serves as the starting point or baseline. In finance, it's the initial
     investment. In machine learning, it's the initial error or discrepancy
     between predicted and actual values.

5. **Interest Rate (Financial) → Learning Rate (Machine Learning):**
   - Reflects the rate of change over time. In finance, it's the percentage at
     which money grows or decays. In machine learning, it governs the rate at
     which the model's weights update during training.

Through these parallels, we establish an analogy between a financial model
(compound interest) and a machine learning context (training and loss
reduction). This imaginative mapping unveils shared patterns and structures
bridging these two domains.

Notably, this analogy is conceptual and exploratory. It exposes intriguing
connections, although it might not directly correlate with established
mathematical or machine learning techniques.

## Experimental Quantitative Analysis

By linking the label (target amount) with loss, epoch, learning rate, and
frequency, we can express the relationship as follows:

```
label = loss * epoch * improvement_rate
label = loss * epoch * (1 + learning_rate / frequency)^epoch
```

Here, the label signifies the desired outcome or target value. This equation
showcases how loss, learning rate, and epoch interact to approach the target.

While a creative analogy, this may not directly correspond to a specific machine
learning algorithm or loss function.

### Expressing Loss

**Step Size:** Represents change magnitude during each training update, akin to
the periodic interest rate in finance.

```
step_size = 1 + learning_rate / frequency
```

**Improvement Rate (Growth Rate):** Indicates the rate of loss reduction during
training, resembling the growth rate in finance.

```
improvement_rate = step_size^epoch
improvement_rate = (1 + learning_rate / frequency)^epoch
```

**Loss (Principal Amount):** The loss function embodies prediction error, akin
to the principal amount in compound interest.

```
loss = desired_loss / (epoch * improvement_rate)
loss = desired_loss / (epoch * (1 + learning_rate / frequency)^epoch)
```

**Target Amount (Label/Desired Outcome):** Mirrors accumulated value per step,
resembling desired outcome or label in machine learning.

```
target_amount = principal_amount * epoch * improvement_rate
target_amount = principal_amount * epoch * (1 + learning_rate / frequency)^epoch
```

Through these parallels, we creatively explored connections between a financial
growth model (compound interest) and a hypothetical machine learning training
scenario. While not directly applicable to a standard machine learning
algorithm, it sheds light on shared mathematical structures and patterns across
domains.

### Calculate the Label

We adapted the concept of compound interest for a hypothetical machine learning
scenario:

- `Step Size (S)`: Represents the magnitude of change at each step, related to
  the learning rate and frequency.
- `Improvement Rate (I)`: The growth or improvement rate at each step,
  calculated as the step size raised to the epoch.
- `Label or Desired Outcome (A)`: The accumulated value or target, represented
  as the loss times the epoch times the improvement rate.

Equation: `A = L * E * (1 + R / F)^E`

### Calculate the Loss

We investigated the inverse relationship, focusing on loss calculation:

- `Loss (L)`: The error between predicted and actual values, analogous to the
  principal amount in finance.
- `Epoch (E)`: A full pass through the training data, analogous to the interval
  in compound interest.
- `Desired Loss (D)`: The minimum loss we aim to achieve, analogous to the
  target amount.

Equation: `L = D / (E * (1 + R / F)^E)`

## The Loss Function Analogy

1. **Market Price**: Comparable to an input or parameter value in machine
   learning used for predictions. In the context of the Value Averaging
   strategy, it denotes the buying or selling price.

2. **Target Value (Label)**: In machine learning, it's the actual outcome we aim
   to predict. In the Value Averaging strategy, it signifies the desired
   investment value at each interval (Current Target).

3. **Current Value (Prediction)**: In Value Averaging, this is the actual
   investment value at a given time. In machine learning, it corresponds to the
   model's prediction based on input features (Market Price).

4. **Trade Amount (Loss)**: This draws a parallel to the loss function. In Value
   Averaging, the Trade Amount represents the difference between the Current
   Target (Label) and the Current Value (Prediction). In machine learning, this
   difference mirrors the loss, indicating the deviation between prediction and
   actual target.

Now, let's explore this concept mathematically:

### Mathematical Representation

In Value Averaging:

```
Trade Amount = Current Target - Current Value
```

In Machine Learning (Loss Function):

```
Loss = Target Value (Label) - Prediction
```

### Equivalent Analogy

- Trade Amount ↔ Loss
- Current Target ↔ Target Value (Label)
- Current Value ↔ Prediction
- Market Price ↔ Input Features

The resemblance between these concepts is intriguing, offering a fresh
perspective on the relationships that can be drawn between financial modeling
and machine learning. A thoughtful approach, beginning with the exploration of
Mean Squared Error (MSE), leads to a deeper understanding. Let's now explore the
integration of the components of our analogy with the concept of MSE.

### Definitions:

- `A`: Target value, representing the desired future investment value.
- `L`: Trade amount or Loss, denoting the difference between target and current
  value.
- `D`: Desired value for each interval (constant or variable).
- `E`: Number of intervals.
- `R`: Rate of return.
- `F`: Frequency of compounding.

### Formulating the Analogy with MSE

In machine learning, MSE calculates the average of squared differences between
predicted and actual target values. Mathematically:

```
MSE = (1/n) * Σ (Prediction_i - Target_i)^2
```

In our analogy, MSE signifies the average of squared differences between
investment's current value and desired target value over intervals:

```
MSE = (1/E) * Σ (Current Value_i - A_i)^2
```

Where:

- `Current Value_i`: Investment's actual value at interval `i`.
- `A_i`: Target value at interval `i`, calculated as
  `A_i = L * E * (1 + R / F)^i`.

### Application

MSE in this context provides insight into alignment of investment strategy with
targets. Lower MSE suggests close alignment, while higher MSE indicates
deviations.

### Further Exploration

We can simulate various investment scenarios, calculating MSE to assess
strategy's alignment with targets. Exploring how parameters like return rate or
compounding frequency influence MSE offers an intriguing avenue.

The MSE analogy bridges investment strategies and machine learning concepts,
enriched by your mathematics and programming background.

## Conclusion

This imaginative analogy draws parallels between compound interest mathematics,
statistical convergence, and hypothetical loss functions in machine learning.
Although not a direct fit for real-world scenarios, it has been an engaging and
thought-provoking endeavor.

Our findings underscore the universal nature of mathematical concepts across
disciplines, highlighting the potential for innovative insights through creative
exploration.
