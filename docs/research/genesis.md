## Hypothesis

We approached this exploration with an open mind, seeking connections between
seemingly unrelated fields. The Law of Large Numbers guided us, hinting at
converging correlations.

### Calculate the Label

We translated the financial concept of compound interest into a hypothetical
scenario in machine learning:

```
Step Size (S): A measure of change at each step.
Improvement Rate (I): The growth rate at each step, calculated as step size raised to the epoch.
Label or Desired Outcome (A): The accumulated value, represented as (loss * epoch * improvement rate).
```

Equation: `A = L * E * (1 + R / F)^E`

### Calculate the Loss

Next, we explored the inverse relationship, focusing on loss calculation:

```
Loss (L): The error between predicted and actual values.
Epoch (E): A full pass through the training data.
Desired Loss (D): The minimum loss we aim for.
```

Equation: `L = D / (E * (1 + R / F)^E)`

## Conclusion

Through this analogy, we've drawn parallels between compound interest math,
statistical convergence, and hypothetical loss functions in machine learning.
While not a direct real-world application, it's been an engaging exercise. This
underscores the universal nature of mathematical concepts and how they appear
across different disciplines, reminding us that creative exploration can lead to
novel insights.
