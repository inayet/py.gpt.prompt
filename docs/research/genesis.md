# Genesis

## Hypothesis

We started this exploration with an open mind, seeking connections between
seemingly unrelated fields. The Law of Large Numbers acted as a guiding
principle, suggesting converging correlations.

### Calculate the Label

We adapted the financial concept of compound interest into a hypothetical
scenario in machine learning:

- `Step Size (S)`: Represents the magnitude of change at each step, related to
  the learning rate and frequency.
- `Improvement Rate (I)`: The growth or improvement rate at each step,
  calculated as the step size raised to the epoch.
- `Label or Desired Outcome (A)`: The accumulated value or target, represented
  as the loss times the epoch times the improvement rate.

Equation: `A = L * E * (1 + R / F)^E`

### Calculate the Loss

Next, we explored the inverse relationship, focusing on calculating the loss:

- `Loss (L)`: The error between predicted and actual values, analogous to the
  principal amount in finance.
- `Epoch (E)`: A full pass through the training data, analogous to the interval
  in compound interest.
- `Desired Loss (D)`: The minimum loss we aim to achieve, analogous to the
  target amount.

Equation: `L = D / (E * (1 + R / F)^E)`

## Conclusion

Through this playful analogy, we've drawn parallels between the mathematics of
compound interest, statistical convergence, and hypothetical loss functions in
machine learning. While not directly applicable to real-world scenarios, it has
been an engaging and thought-provoking exercise.

The connections we've made emphasize how mathematical concepts are universal and
can appear in various forms across different disciplines. It serves as a
reminder that creative exploration can lead to novel insights and connections.
