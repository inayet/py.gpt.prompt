## Genesis

### Hypothesis

We embarked on this exploration with an open mind, looking to find connections
between seemingly unrelated fields. The Law of Large Numbers served as a guiding
principle, hinting at converging correlations.

### Calculate the Label

We translated the financial concept of compound interest into a hypothetical
scenario in machine learning:

- **Step Size (S):** A measure representing the magnitude of change at each
  step, related to the learning rate and frequency.
- **Improvement Rate (I):** The rate of growth or improvement at each step,
  calculated as the step size raised to the epoch.
- **Label or Desired Outcome (A):** The accumulated value or target, represented
  as the loss times the epoch times the improvement rate.

The equation for calculating the label or desired outcome: \[ A = L \cdot E
\cdot \left(1 + \frac{R}{F}\right)^E \]

### Calculate the Loss

Next, we explored the inverse relationship, focusing on how to calculate the
loss:

- **Loss (L):** The error between predicted and actual values, analogous to the
  principal amount in finance.
- **Epoch (E):** A full pass through the training data, analogous to the
  interval in compound interest.
- **Desired Loss (D):** The minimum loss we aim to achieve, analogous to the
  target amount.

The equation for calculating the loss: \[ L = \frac{D}{E \cdot \left(1 +
\frac{R}{F}\right)^E} \]

## Conclusion

Through this playful analogy, we've drawn parallels between the mathematics of
compound interest, statistical convergence, and hypothetical loss functions in
machine learning. While this may not directly correspond to real-world
applications, it has been an engaging and thought-provoking exercise.

The connections made here underline the universality of mathematical concepts
and how they can manifest in various forms across different disciplines. It's a
reminder that creative thinking and a willingness to explore can lead to novel
insights and connections.
