### Comprehensive Guide on Special Tokens, Templating, and Dataset Implications in Large Language Models

#### Issue Description

There appears to be some ambiguity and misunderstanding around the
functionalities of special tokens, templating, and the role of datasets in Large
Language Models. This documentation aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to
clarify these areas.

#### Tokenizers and SentencePiece

Tokenizers serve as the bridge between raw text and the model's understanding of
language. For example,
[SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/blob/master/README.md#technical-highlights)
allows you to map a vocabulary to encodings. This can be done using various
subword algorithms like BPE, SPE, Unigram, etc.

```python
# Example using SentencePiece
>>> import sentencepiece as spm
>>> model_path = "models/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tokenizer.model"
>>> sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor(model_file=model_path)
>>> vocab_size = sp.get_piece_size()
>>> print(vocab_size)
32000
>>> sp.encode("This is a sample sentence with <s>special</s> tokens.", out_type=int)
[910, 338, 263, 4559, 10541, 411, 529, 29879, 29958, 18732, 829, 29879, 29958, 18897, 29889]
>>> 
```

#### Special Tokens

Special tokens like `<s>` and `</s>` are used to indicate the start and end of
sequences or for other specific functions. These tokens have to be included in
the vocabulary and handled appropriately during both training and inference.

#### Templating in Llama-CPP

Templates serve as a blueprint that allows the tokenizer and language model to
understand how to process and generate text based on different use-cases. They
can affect the outputs of the language model and dictate what kinds of tokens
are to be expected.

#### Dataset and its Impact on Tokenizers

Datasets play a critical role in how a tokenizer is trained and operates. A
dataset with a diverse vocabulary will enable a tokenizer to be more versatile
in understanding and generating text. The tokenizer's ability to handle special
tokens will also be affected by the quality of the dataset it's trained on.

```python
# Example illustrating the correlation between tokenizer and dataset
>>> import json
>>> def load_tokenizer_data(file_path):
...     """Load tokenizer data from a given JSON file."""
...     with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as json_file:
...         return json.load(json_file)
... 
>>> def find_key_path(data, target_key):
...     """Recursively search for a key in a nested dictionary and return its path as a list."""
...     if isinstance(data, dict):
...         if target_key in data:
...             return [target_key]
...         for key, value in data.items():
...             path = find_key_path(value, target_key)
...             if path:
...                 return [key] + path
...     elif isinstance(data, list):
...         for idx, item in enumerate(data):
...             path = find_key_path(item, target_key)
...             if path:
...                 return [idx] + path
...     return None
... 
>>> tokenizer_data = load_tokenizer_data("models/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tokenizer.json")
>>> tokenizer_data["model"]["type"]
'BPE'
>>> find_key_path(tokenizer_data, "▁This")
['model', 'vocab', '▁This']
>>> tokenizer_data["model"]["vocab"]["▁This"]
910
>>> 
```

#### Model Architecture and Training

A transformer model uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to train. It uses
derivatives to correct errors during the training process. RMSprop, an
optimization algorithm, uses the gradient of the loss with respect to the model
weights for adjustments.

```python
# Model training pseudo-code
for epoch in epochs:
    for batch in batches:
        loss = compute_loss(model, batch)
        gradients = compute_gradients(loss)
        update_weights(model, gradients, optimizer="RMSprop")
```

#### Tokenizer JSON and Reverse Mapping

The `tokenizer.json` will have the encoded vocabulary mapping in JSON format.
This can be used to decipher what the encodings map to.

```python
# Example of reverse mapping
import json

def load_tokenizer_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as json_file:
        return json.load(json_file)

tokenizer_data = load_tokenizer_data("models/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tokenizer.json")
tokenizer_data["model"]["vocab"]["▁This"]  # Output: 910
```

#### Importance of Special Tokens

Special tokens are critical for the model's underlying architecture. They impact
various stages, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and low-level inference
processes.

**Important Note**: Users should avoid modifying these tokens as improper use
can lead to issues such as token fixation, repetitive language patterns, and
hallucinations.

#### Templating in Llama-CPP

Templates serve as a blueprint for how the tokenizer and model process and
generate text. The structure of the template can significantly affect the
quality and accuracy of the output.

**Proper Templating Example**

```plaintext
 1  <<SYS>>My name is Llama and I am a helpful assistant.<</SYS>>$
 2  [INST] Hello Llama, my name is User. What's your name? [/INST]$
 3  Hello User, my name is Llama. Nice to meet you!$
 4  [INST] What can you do? [/INST]$
 5  I can assist you with various tasks, including providing structured output for certain queries.$
 6  [INST] How can you assist me in my programming projects? [/INST]$
 7  $
```

**Improper Templating Example**

```plaintext
 1  <<SYS>>My name is Llama and I am a helpful assistant.<</SYS>>$
 2  $
 3  <s>[INST] Hello Llama, my name is User. What's your name? [/INST]$
 4  Hello User, my name is Llama. Nice to meet you!</s>$
 5  $
 6  <s>[INST] What can you do? [/INST]$
 7  I can assist you with various tasks, including providing structured output for certain queries.</s>$
 8  $
 9  <s>[INST] How can you assist me in my programming projects? [/INST]$
10  $
```

Improper use of special tokens and separators can lead to erratic model
behavior.
