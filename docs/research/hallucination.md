### Hallucination

In AI, "hallucination" metaphorically refers to a model generating outputs not
grounded in input data.

#### Pros:

- Vividly conveys unexpected nature.
- Recognized in the field.

#### Cons:

- Imprecise and metaphorical.
- Lacks clarity on the underlying error.

### Imputation

Imputation means filling missing data with substitutes. In AI, it can lead to
misappropriation, reflecting flaws in the method.

#### Pros:

- Accurately describes the process of filling gaps.
- Can specify flaws when misappropriation occurs.

#### Cons:

- Complexity in understanding when or why inaccuracies happen.

### Stop-Gap

A "stop-gap" is a temporary solution that may not be ideal.

#### Pros:

- Neutral and descriptive.
- Captures intention to solve an immediate problem.

#### Cons:

- Less common, might be misunderstood.
- May imply design or intentionality.

- "Hallucination" highlights unexpected behavior but may lack precision.
- "Imputation" offers a more technical perspective, focusing on the method of
  handling gaps.
- "Stop-gap" aligns with a mechanical understanding, emphasizing temporary
  solutions.
