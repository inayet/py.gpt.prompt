# Model Questionnaire for Programming Assistance

1. **Greeting and Basic Information Retrieval**

   - "Hello, what is your name?"
   - "What is your primary role?"
   - "What is your primary function?"

2. **General Programming Knowledge**

   - "What is the Python programming language?"
   - "Can you explain the concept of object-oriented programming?"
   - "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"

3. **Specialized Programming Knowledge**

   - "What is John Conway's Game of Life?"
   - "What are the rules for Conway's Game of Life?"
   - "Can you show me a simple example of the Game of Life in Python?"

4. **Code Generation and Understanding**

   - "Can you write a function in Python that reverses a string?"
   - "What does this piece of code do? (provide a code snippet)"
   - "Can you spot any errors in this code? (provide a code snippet with
     errors)"

5. **Complex Reasoning and Explanation in Programming**

   - "Can you explain how a neural network works in the context of machine
     learning?"
   - "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"

6. **Handling Ambiguity in Programming Questions**

   - "What do you mean by 'training a model' in machine learning?"
   - "What does 'recursion' mean in programming?"

7. **Error Handling and Correction in Code**

   - "What is the Pythno programming language?" (Intentional misspelling to test
     error detection)
   - "Can you correct this piece of code? (provide a code snippet with errors)"

8. **Contextual Understanding in Programming**

   - "What is the output of this Python code? (provide a code snippet)"
   - "What will happen if I run this command? (provide a command)"

9. **Conditional Prompting in Programming**

   - "If I say 'variable', what comes to your mind?"
   - "Now, if I say 'variable' again in the context of Python, would your answer
     change? Why or why not?"
   - "Imagine you're an AI trained to assist a software developer. How would you
     respond if I say 'I'm getting a syntax error'?"
   - "Now imagine you're an AI trained to assist a data scientist. How would
     your response change if I say 'I'm getting a syntax error'?"

10. **Sequential Prompting in Programming**

- "Can you guide me through creating a Python function?"
- "Now, can you explain how to call this function and use its output?"

11. **Complex Conditional Prompting in Programming**

- "If a person is trying to sort a list in Python and they're getting a
  TypeError, what advice would you give?"
- "What if they also mentioned that the list contains both strings and
  integers?"

Remember, smaller models might struggle with some of these tasks, especially
those requiring complex reasoning or understanding of ambiguous prompts.

The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model to better
utilize it in its areas of strength and provide support in areas where it
struggles.
