# PyGPTPrompt

PyGPTPrompt is a CLI tool designed to enhance user interactions with advanced AI
models. It specializes in managing context windows, optimizing the long-term
memory performance of models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and those supported
by the llama.cpp Python API. By streamlining data ingestion and facilitating
task automation, PyGPTPrompt serves as an effective interface for AI model
interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- Poetry (Python packaging and dependency management tool)

## Features

- **Context Window Management:** PyGPTPrompt's core functionality lies in its
  efficient management of context windows, enhancing the long-term memory
  performance of AI models.

- **Data Ingestion:** It simplifies the process of feeding data into AI models,
  further enhancing their long-term memory performance.

- **Task Automation:** PyGPTPrompt enables effective task automation with AI
  models, saving time and improving productivity.

- **Multiple Model Support:** It integrates with OpenAI and GGML models,
  supporting those quantized to 4, 5, and 8-bit variations supported by the
  llama.cpp library.

- **First-Class Support for OpenAI GPT Models:** Designed with OpenAI's GPT
  models in mind, PyGPTPrompt integrates with these AI models through their
  functions API.

- **Flexible Configuration:** Comes with comprehensive configuration files for
  customization of various parameters and settings, catering to a wide range of
  use cases and requirements.

## Development Status

PyGPTPrompt is currently in an experimental prototype phase. While functional
and showing promising potential, it is under active development and not yet
production-ready. The solo developer behind this project is committed to
refining and enhancing PyGPTPrompt, making it a versatile tool for managing AI
models' context windows and facilitating user interactions.
